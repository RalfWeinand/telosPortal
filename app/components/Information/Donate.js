      <h5>Dear telosToolkit supporters,</h5>
      <p>
        The <strong>telosToolkit</strong> was made out of love prior to the launch of the Telos mainnet thanks to long
        hours late into the night and a staunch belief in making EOS accessible to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to your support and votes <strong>TelosGermany</strong> now receives block rewards and this helps fund
        further development of the telosToolkit and other Telos projects.
      </p>
      <p>However, the goal of TelosGermany is to give back to the community.</p>
      <p>
        By donating you will be supporting development of the <strong>telosToolkit</strong> directly, while allowing
        TelosGermany to give even more back to those who need it most.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope you love the <strong>telosToolkit</strong> as much as I{"'"}ve loved forking and changing the fantastic
        eostoolkit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>&hearts;,</strong>
        <br />
        Andre Litty, TelosGermany
      </p>
